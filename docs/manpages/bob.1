.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bob
\fI<plan file or URI> \fR[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Bob the Constructinator a.k.a. \fBbob\fR is a command line tool written in python to automate building packages from a git repo into a conary package consumable for Conary enabled systems. bob can leverage WMS and git to enable continuous integration builds.

\fBbob\fR uses a bob-plan to build a conary recipe from a scm checkout. bob supports git, WMS, and hg (mercurial). Bob can build a specific tag or version of an scm repo through command line options.

\fBProcedure\fR

Create a git repo for source
Create a conary recipe to build source
Create a bob-plan for git repo
Run bob passing the location of the plan file

   showBuildLogs           = Boolean defaults False toggle verbose build logs
   defaultBuildReqs        = List of Strings of defaultBuildReqs for build (list of troves to be added to buildRequirements regardless of what is specified in recipe)
   rpmRequirements         = List of Dependencies specifying the version of rpm to during chroot construction
   # misc
   commitMessage           = String conary commit message defaults to 'Automated clone by bob'
   skipMacros              = List of strings of macros to not include ['version']
   # debugging
   dumpRecipes             = Boolean True dumps the contents of the conary recipe to be built
   depMode                 = Boolean True ???
   recipeDir               = String representation of the path to the conary recipe directory

Target Section config options
   scm                     = String represents the location of the git repo
   after                   = List of Strings used to make sure target is built after a parent target
   classVar                = Dictionary of Conary recipe Class Variables values to be munged
   flavor_mask             = String representing the Flavor Mask for the troves
   flavor_set              = String representing the Flavor Set for the troves
   flavor                  = String representing the Flavor of the trove
   macros                  = Dictionary of conary macros passed in to the rmake job
   version                 = String representing the version of the trove and repo to be mangled by bob in final trove
   sourceTree              = String path to the directory containing the conary recipe and any files required for the trove
   serializeFlavors        = 
   noBuild                 = Boolean True tells bob to skip building and only commit the source to the conary repo  
   factory                 = String representing the conary factory used to build the conary recipe
